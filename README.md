# heartFailure

Code to identifying proteins that discriminate between two **heart failure phenotypes** 
using proteomic data. 

## General analysis

**Five feature selection (FS) techniques** were applied to identify the most relevant biomarkers
for each dataset. The top 20 most important proteins from each FS method were selected,
and the **common proteins were defined as the relevant biomarkers** for heart failure
phenotype discrimination. 

**Venn diagrams and heatmaps** were used to display the results for the different
FS methods together.

For each relevant biomarker, an **individual predictor** was evaluated using ROC 
analysis. 

## Estructure

This repository contains:

* **Two R scripts** for analyzing TPA and LFQ proteomics data 
independently (*LFQanalysis.R* and _TPAanalysis.R_).  

* **All input data** required by the  scripts, consisting of proteomic data matrices for
TPA and LFQ intensities (folder _in_).

* **All outputs** generated by the scripts, stored in the out folder, including: 


    * An Excel file with the results from each FS method, the combined results, and the classification metrics from the ROC analysis
    * Two SVG images showing the Venn diagram and heatmap with the combined results.
